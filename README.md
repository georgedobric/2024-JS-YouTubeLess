# 2024-JS-YouTubeLess
YouTubeLess is a chrome extension designed to let you use YouTube as a search engine by making the 'Home' page blank. Take back your time and avoid getting sucked into YouTube's algorithm, which is preying on your attention. Further customizability will include user-control of these minimalist features, allowing toggle functionality.
